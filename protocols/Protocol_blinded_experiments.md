#### Solutions

Evoked oscillations are recorded in baseline $\rightarrow$ drug/control $\rightarrow$ washout solutions.

1. Baseline = ACSF containing: 
    - 10 mM BMI
    - 0.001% DMSO (5 uL DMSO in 500 mL ACSF)

2. Drug =  ACSF containing:
    - 10 mM BMI
    - 100 nM CLC2 blocker (a 10 mM, 50 uL aliquot is used per 500 mL solution)
        - 50uL blocker aliquot made by adding 5 uL blocker/DMSO (stock) to 45 uL ACSF

3. Control = ACSF containing
    - 10 mM BMI
    - 0 nM CLC2 blocker (a 50 uL aliquot is used per 500 mL solution)
        - 50uL control aliquot made by adding 5 uL DMSO to 45 uL ACSF

4. Washout = baseline solution

#### Randomization

Mark will randomize and label the tubes with numbers, writing down which number corresponds to which condition in a spreadsheet. He gives me the aliquots and I am blinded.

#### Experiment Protocol

For each slice, I will begin by recording oscillations in the baseline solution. The stimulation is 100 V, 0.5 ms every 60 seconds. I will take at least 20 sweeps of baseline. The baseline condition will be extended if the durations of each of the last five sweeps are not within +/-20% of the mean duration. After duration stability is achieved, I will then switch to the "drug"  or "control" solution for 30 sweeps, then switch back for 20 sweeps of washout before I put on the next slice.
